# Missiles
--- 
Rocket Riders features 20 all new, community-made missiles. The missiles are divided into four categories, ranging in speed, explosive power, and availability in certain gamemodes.

Each category is listed below along with all the missiles in them. Click on the name of each missile to see more information about it!

**Normal Damage Missiles**
---
These are neither as fast as Lightning Speed Missiles nor as destructive as Heavy Damage Missiles; just somewhere in between. There are 10 missiles in this category:

- [A.N.T](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/ant) - Stands for Almost No TNT. It is one of the smallest functional missiles, made with only two TNT blocks.  
- [Blade](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/blade) - A sword-shaped missile. Breaking the slime block on the side will drop down 3 bomber TNT below it.
- [Catapult](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/catapult) - Once it contacts a wall, it launches 2 TNT blocks out. You can also launch TNT by breaking the back slime block.
- [Chronullifier](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/chronullifier) - Uses a unique observer engine with the same speed as non-observer engines.
- [Citadel](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/citadel) - Good for surprise attacks. You can climb inside the missile using the trapdoor on top of it.
- [Elder Guardian](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/elderguardian) - An upgrade from the Guardian in Missile Wars, the Elder Guardian is bigger and covers the TNT better.
- [Gemini](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/gemini) - A twin missile. If one side is stopped, the other side of the missile will keep going.
- [Lifter](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/lifter) - Lifts its warhead up by 3 blocks when it hits an obstacle.
- [Slasher](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/slasher) - A glass-encased missile with not much TNT. It can slash straight through Shields.
- [TomaTwo](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/normal/tomatwo) - A missile inspired by the Tomahawk from Missile Wars. This missile uses an observer engine.

**Heavy Damage Missiles**
---
These deal the most damage of any missiles (besides Special Missiles) in the game, at the cost of being more dangerous to ride without disarming.

- [Auxiliary](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/auxiliary) - This missile has 6 trigger TNT in it, making it risky to defuse.
- [Juggerbuster](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/juggerbuster) - This missile has the power of a Juggernaut plus the ability to bust through Shields.
- [Rifter](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/rifter) - An observer engine missile with plenty of TNT to blow up a portal.
- [Warhead](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/warhead) - A Juggernaut-style missile. When it hits a wall, a piston will cover up the trigger TNT.

**Lightning Speed Missiles**
---
These travel faster than any missiles (besides the Hypersonic) in the game, at the cost of being harder to deploy and ride successfully.

- [Hurricane](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/lightning/hurricane) - Bears much resemblance to the Lightning from Missile Wars, but features more TNT and a tight design.
- [Thunderbolt](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/lightning/thunderbolt) - Breaking too much TNT may stop this missile, but its length and 2x2 form factor make it easier to ride.


**Special Missiles**
---
These missiles are available exclusively in Powerups Mode and Swap Mode, as they are each too overpowered for general gameplay.

- [Broadsword](<actualur.>.github.io/missiles/special/broadsword) - A fast and powerful missile that bombs a lot of TNT. It's like three swords combined!
- [Bullet](<actualur.>.github.io/missiles/special/bullet) - With 44 TNT, 12 of which being triggers, the Bullet makes all missiles look like an A.N.T.
- [Duplex](<actualur.>.github.io/missiles/special/duplex) - Like a ShieldBuster, but instead of going through a Shield, it will blow it up and keep on flying.
- [Hypersonic](<actualur.>.github.io/missiles/special/hypersonic) - The fastest missile in the game. It might be very hard to get on this one!
