**Heavy Damage Missiles**
---
These deal the most damage of any missiles (besides Special Missiles) in the game, at the cost of being more dangerous to ride without disarming.

- [Auxiliary](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/auxiliary) - This missile has 6 trigger TNT in it, making it risky to defuse.
- [Juggerbuster](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/juggerbuster) - This missile has the power of a Juggernaut plus the ability to bust through Shields.
- [Rifter](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/rifter) - An observer engine missile with plenty of TNT to blow up a portal.
- [Warhead](<actualurl>.github.io/missiles/heavy/warhead) - A Juggernaut-style missile. When it hits a wall, a piston will cover up the trigger TNT.
